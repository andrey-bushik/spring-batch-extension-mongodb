MongoDB implementations of Spring Batch meta-data persistence DAOs (ExecutionContextDao, JobExecutionDao, JobInstanceDao, StepExecutionDao).

Inspired by [springbatch-over-mongodb](https://github.com/jbaruch/springbatch-over-mongodb) and the current JDBC implementations.

 ~~It is based on Spring Batch 2.2.0.RELEASE.~~ Migrated to the latest versions of Spring Batch (3.0.7.RELEASE) and MongoDB driver (3.4.2).
